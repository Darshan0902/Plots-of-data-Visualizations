# Plots-of-data-Visualizations

In the below notebook , I have included overall 9 graphs where I have made sure that I give descirpiton for each of them do check them out and for more infromation Do visit my kaggle or Linkedin.


raphs we are gonna be learning in this Notebook :

Histogram
Bar chart
Pie chart
Box-Plot
Scatterplot
Line Plot
Horizontal bar chart
Violin Plot
WORD CLOUD


Libraries used and their definitons ...
Matplotlib.pyplot
matplotlib.pyplot is a collection of functions that make matplotlib work like MATLAB. Each pyplot function makes some change to a figure: e.g., creates a figure, creates a plotting area in a figure, plots some lines in a plotting area, decorates the plot with labels, etc.

numpy
NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

A histogram is a graphical representation of data points organized into user-specified ranges. Similar in appearance to a bar graph, the histogram condenses a data series into an easily interpreted visual by taking many data points and grouping them into logical ranges or bins . A histogram displays numerical data by grouping data into "bins" of equal width. Each bin is plotted as a bar whose height corresponds to how many data points are in that bin.Bins are also sometimes called "intervals", "classes", or "buckets".
